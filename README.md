# What's Quest Bot?
Quest bot is a bot that I (mangoess#4904) have developed for the Questions and Quotes team!

# What exactly is my vision
**To reduce the workload!**
Let me elaborate, there are 2 main commands
**The first command**, is .suggest (Question), you put the question then you'll receive a message explaining how you have a chance for your question to be sent in a specific time (The time is to be decided with the rest of the team!)
**The second command**, is .random, this command can only be used by staff with a specific role (Ideally Advisory team cause all messages are sent by people with that role), It will then randomly pick a question (or quote) from the database that a user suggested and automatically put the message in with the correct format!
(ALL QUOTES / QUESTIONS WILL BE CHECKED FOR ANY INNAP WORDS OR PHRASES)

# Why is this a better alternative then just staff doing it themselves?
Well there is 1 main reason, The reason is that it engages with the community, if a person get's their question / quote featured, it'll make them want to return! This can lead to a better trust!

# WHY ARE YOU USING JAVASCRIPT AND NOT (INSERT OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE HERE)?
idk don't judge i beg
